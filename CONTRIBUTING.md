# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

> [!TIP]
> By following these rules, anyone who wants to contribute to this young project will be able to properly organize their work and really help this project a lot.

## Keep it simple
Never complicate your task when it is not necessary. Write simply and clearly. This way you will not get confused and you will not mislead others.

## Divide and conquer
A great rule that will never be useless! Break your tasks into smaller ones. For each separate logical part of your work, make a separate branch, but do not overdo it! :) This way you will be able to keep control even over very complex work.

## Don't be afraid of criticism
If there were many complaints about your changes during the code review, this is not a reason to get upset and stop helping. Look at all the comments from the reviewer, ask the necessary questions, if any, and fix the problems.
