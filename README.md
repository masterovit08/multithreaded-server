# Socket project (multithreaded server version)

## About the creation
This is the best and most correctly working version of my Java multiplayer console chat project. This version is a copy of the previous version with an interface, rewritten for the console.

## About the running program
The client needs to connect to the server and enter a nickname that will be displayed in the system in order to start chatting. Communication takes place as in a regular chat, with notifications about the accession of a new client and the departure of an existing user.
